Message: When present, the notes element should only be used to contain a revision summary (an fn-group with the content-type 'summary-of-updates'). This notes element contains other content. Is it redundant? Or should the content be moved elsewhere? (coi statements should be in author-notes; clinical trial numbers should be included as a realted-object in a structured abstract (if it already exists) or as related-object in article-meta; data/code/ethics/funding statements can be included in additional information in new or existing section(s), as appropriate) -->
