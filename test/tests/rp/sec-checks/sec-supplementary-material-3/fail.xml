Message: sec has a title suggesting its content might relate to additional files, but it doesn't contain a supplementary-material element. If this section contains captions for supplementary files, then these should be added to the appropriate <supplementary-material>. If the files are not present in the article at all, the captions should be removed (or the files added as new <supplementary-material>). -->
