    <abstract><sec id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Hypoxia and consequent production of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) promotes blood vessel leakiness and edema in ocular diseases. Anti-VEGFA therapeutics may aggravate hypoxia; therefore, therapy development is needed.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Oxygen-induced retinopathy was used as a model to test the role of nitric oxide (NO) in pathological neovascularization and vessel permeability. Suppression of NO formation was achieved chemically using L-NMMA, or genetically, in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) serine to alanine (S1176A) mutant mice.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Suppression of NO formation resulted in reduced retinal neoangiogenesis. Remaining vascular tufts exhibited reduced vascular leakage through stabilized endothelial adherens junctions, manifested as reduced phosphorylation of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin Y685 in a c-Src-dependent manner. Treatment with a single dose of L-NMMA in established retinopathy restored the vascular barrier and prevented leakage.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We conclude that NO destabilizes adherens junctions, resulting in vascular hyperpermeability, by converging with the VEGFA/VEGFR2/c-Src/VE-cadherin pathway.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This study was supported by the Swedish Cancer foundation (19 0119 Pj 01 hr), the Swedish Research Council (2020&#x2013;01349), the Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation (KAW 2020.0057) and a Fondation Leducq Transatlantic Network of Excellence Grant in Neurovascular Disease (17 CVD 03).
