        <p>Collagen is a major component of extracellular matrix. The authors have identified a
          high-affinity inhibitory collagen receptor LAIR-1 and a soluble decoy receptor LAIR-2
          (with even higher binding affinity to collagen), which can be therapeutically targeted to
          block tumor progression. Dr Meyaard and colleagues have also generated a dimeric LAIR-2
          human IgG1 Fc fusion protein NC410 for therapeutic use. With humanized mouse models
          engrafted with functional human immune systems (PBMC), they have explored the anti-cancer
          efficacy of NC410 and revealed its impact on modulating immune responses. Furthermore,
          they extended this study to identify biomarkers of predictive value for NC410-based
          anti-cancer therapy.</p>
