    <p>The 3D segmentation of synaptic junctions includes both the presynaptic density (active zone; AZ) and the PSD. Since the AZ and the PSD are located face to face, their surface areas are very similar (correlation coefficients over 0.97; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schikorski and Stevens, 1999</xref>). Thus, as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morales et al., 2013</xref>), they can be simplified to a single surface and represented as the surface of apposition between the AZ and the PSD. This surface can be extracted from the 3D segmented synaptic junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morales et al., 2013</xref>). For the sake of clarity, we have referred to this surface as the synaptic apposition surface (SAS). We consider SAS morphological measurements to be a better approach to the assessment of synaptic size than measurements obtained from the 3D segmented synaptic junctions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morales et al., 2013</xref> for more detailed information about SAS extraction and its relation to presynaptic density and PSD). We observed in our samples that the SAS area is highly correlated to the surface (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96 for AS; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97 for SS) and the volume (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91 for AS; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90 for SS) of the 3D segmented synaptic junctions.</p>
