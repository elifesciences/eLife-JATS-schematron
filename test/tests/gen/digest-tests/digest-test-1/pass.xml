        <p>In most environments, organisms compete for limited resources. The number and relative
          abundance of species that an ecosystem can host is referred to as ‘species
          diversity’. The competitive-exclusion principle is a hypothesis which proposes
          that, in an ecosystem, competition for resources results in decreased diversity: only
          species best equipped to consume the available resources thrive, while their less
          successful competitors die off. However, many natural ecosystems foster a wide array of
          species despite offering relatively few resources.</p>
        <p>Researchers have proposed many competing theories to explain how this paradox can emerge,
          but they have mainly focused on ecosystems where nutrients are steadily supplied. By
          contrast, less is known about the way species diversity is maintained when nutrients are
          only intermittently available, for example in ecosystems that have seasons.</p>
        <p>To address this question, Erez, Lopez et al. modeled communities of bacteria in which
          nutrients were repeatedly added and then used up. Depending on conditions, a variety of
          relationships between the amount of nutrient supplied and community diversity could
          emerge, suggesting that ecosystems do not follow a simple, universal rule that dictates
          species diversity. In particular, the resulting communities displayed a higher diversity
          of microbes than the limit imposed by the competitive-exclusion principle.</p>
        <p>Further observations allowed Erez, Lopez et al. to suggest guiding principles for when
          diversity in ecosystems will be maintained or lost. In this framework,
          ‘early-bird’ species, which rapidly use a subset of the available nutrients,
          grow to dominate the ecosystem. Even though ‘late-bird’ species are more
          effective at consuming the remaining resources, they cannot compete with the increased
          sheer numbers of the ‘early-birds’, leading to a
          ‘rich-get-richer’ phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Oceanic plankton, arctic permafrost and many other threatened, resource-poor ecosystems
          across the world can dramatically influence our daily lives. Closer to home, shifts in the
          microbe communities that live on the surface of the human body and in the digestive system
          are linked to poor health. Understanding how species diversity emerges and changes will
          help to protect our external and internal environments.</p>
